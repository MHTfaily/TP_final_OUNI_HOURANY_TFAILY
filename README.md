# TP_final_OUNI_HOURANY_TFAILY

# Introduction

In this project you can explore reduction dimensionality and clustering on 2000 datapoints of the ng20 dataset. You can choose the Dimensionality Reduction of your choice and the result will be NMI and ARI of the models.
In the initial phase of the project we created a Docker image that was huge because of the transformers libraries.
In the second phase we created a lighter Docker image that contains the embeddings of the data generated by the transformers in a pickle format, so we don't need to load the librairies anymore.



## Installation

We recommend to install the lighter Docker image. For any other reason you can download the initial Docker image or download the code directly from the github repo and run it on your local machine:
